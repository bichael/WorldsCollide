Knight: I tried to fight off the invasion but then I saw what looked like hairless rabbits invading. 
As embarrassing as it is to say, I have a terrible fear of those animals. 
It came from encountering one that killed several of my fellow knights. 
There was a weapon we used to destroy the monster: the Holy Hand Grenade. 
Last I remember we stored it in the enchanted forest 
where travellers can easily get lost or have a hard time returning.

Knight:Ah yes! That’s the Holy Hand Grenade!
As for how to use it, the instructions are as follows:
‘And the Lord spake, saying, First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin.
Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.
Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, 
and the number of the counting shalt be three.
Four shalt thou not count,
nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.
Five is right out. 
Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then
lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade
towards thy foe, who being naughty in my sight, shall snuf it.’

Knight: Please eradicate the rad rabbits so I can enter the fight without fear.

Mage: *sniffle* My magic staff was stolen by a gang of villains that seem to control fire. 
My favorite magic is fireballs so I only cast the spell fireball. It’s the greatest magic around no exception. 
Their boss took my staff of fireballs that I use to cast my beloved magic 
and I made a tactical retreat and most definitely did not cry the whole way back *sniffle*. 

Mage: *gasp* You got back my staff! So you can beat the villains that were able to beat my all powerful fireball magic?!?
You are worthy then, take my fireball staff and show the world that fireball magic is best magic...
except against opponents that control fire.

Mage: How do you like the staff? Fireball magic is best magic, don’t you agree?

Melody: When the creatures from other dimensions started invading, I tried to help in the fight. 
While I’m not that great at fighting with weapons or magic, I can boost my voice up to 233 decibels. 
But some metal automatons I encountered we able to shut their ability to hear off and were immune to my voice, so I ran.

Prisoner 1: I saw the lich choose green as the first part of the door code when opening the door to his lair.

Prisoner 2: I saw the lich choose aqua as the second part of the door code when opening the door to his lair.

Prisoner 3: I saw the lich choose red as the third part of the door code when opening the door to his lair.

Prisoner 4: I saw the lich choose yellow as the fourth part of the door code when opening the door to his lair.
